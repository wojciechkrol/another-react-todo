# Another React + Redux Todo application

![Another React Todo Application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wojciechkrol/another-react-todo/master/assets/screenshot.png)

This is my first React + Redux mini project and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In this case I wanted to learn how to build Components, use Containers and application state using Redux.

## Installation

`npm install`

## Start application

To start application in development mode use `npm run start` and launch in your browser `http://localhost:3000`
